# REST API and Dashboard exercise

I came across this awesome exercise while browsing Solita’s website and looking for information about their Dev Academy. The application period had already ended, but I decided to complete the exercise just for fun.

## Backend

- REST API built with Spring Boot.
- Supports sorting, pagination, and filtering via query parameters.
- Includes examples of unit, JSON serialization, controller, JDBC, and integration/end-to-end tests.


## Frontend

- Dashboard build with React.
- Styled using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS.
- Data fetching with TanStack Query providing:
  - Caching
  - Loading and error handling
